     <h2 class="LA">Directions</h2><br /> <p class="LA">1)Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in<br /> flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce<br /> temperature and let simmer.<br /> 2)Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a<br /> lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so<br /> that it does not run off.<br /> 3)Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175<br /> degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.</p>
